Lazy-Coding
===========

Being lazy == fast

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
But really what is the deal?

Basicaly the following:

write the follwoing in a file:

private int numbers;

private String tag;

private ArrayList<Book>;


So what's next?

Lazy-Coding will read those, and write the classes, constructors, getters, setters, equals method, toString and JUnit tests while adding Javadoc style commentary.

The drawback?
It's not coded yet...

But can't you just write those yourself?
Sure, if I've got nothing more important to do for 5hours.

Why aren't you just using tool x?
I like programming so I just made it myself.
